This background coordinator is defined as an assembly, separate from the main plugin. It's functionality may be integrated into the current plugin by allowing certain parts to be injected/called at certain points. For example, the background part of this package should be called by the plugin as such, whereas the others may be called upon need. The general usage scenario of this package should be done based on APIs, which should be clearly stated and referenced inside the package code.
